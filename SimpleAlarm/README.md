A Simple daily one time alarm for reminders...  
Plays a soft sound for a few seconds when alarm goes off.  
Made with vanilla js, uses tabs permissions to communicate to a background script.  
No special code for playing the sound.  


Mostly a proof of concept, WIP, feel free to clone, remix, fork, etc :P <br/>
